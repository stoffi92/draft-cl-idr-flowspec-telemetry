        This document describes an architecture that enables originators of flow
        specification rules as described in <xref target="RFC5575" /> to receive
        telemetry feedback on packets matching the announced flows. It solves
        one of the major problems (non-existent feedback loop between the
        originator of a Flowspec rule and the network where the rule is
        applied) for operators using BGP Flowspec.

      <t>
        This document describes an architecture that enables originators of flow
        specification rules as described in <xref target="RFC5575" /> to receive
        telemetry feedback on packets matching the announced flows. It solves
        one of the major problems (non-existent feedback loop between the
        originator of a Flowspec rule and the network where the rule is applied)
        for operators using BGP Flowspec.
      </t>
      <t>
        <xref target="RFC5575" /> defines a BGP NLRI that enables BGP speakers
        to exchange flow filters (match conditions) together with flow-actions
        via BGP. The exchanged flow filters are applied to the forwarding path
        and may modify the forwarding behaviour of packets matching the flow
        filters. One major application of BGP Flowspec is DDoS mitigation.
      </t>
      <t>
        The absence of feedback loop is one of the major blockers for
        Inter-AS DDoS mitigation. Currently the originator of a Flowspec filter
        has no standardized way of receiving any statistical feedback from the
        network regarding matching packets for the originated filters. This is
        especially problematic if Flowspec filters are exchanged between
        different autonomous systems. Currently there exist few approaches to
        gather telemetry for FlowSpec filters. In some implementations per flow
        specification counters can be polled using CLI or SNMP or Netconf.
        Another approach is to export traffic statistics using flow-based
        telemetry like IPFIX defined in <xref target="RFC7011" /> where traffic
        flows dropped with FlowSpec have SNMP index of egress interface set to
        0. Both approaches have very limited application in Inter-AS use cases.
      </t>
      <t>
        This document defines an architecture thats allows a network originating
        Flowspec filters to receive telemetry data for its announcements. When a
        originator of a Flowspec filter wants to receive telemetry for a filter
        it adds a BGP extended community to the filter announcement. This
        extended community encodes the destination for telemetry streaming. Upon
        receiving this extended community network devices establish a restconf
        HTTP2 session as described in <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-netconf-restconf-notif"/> with a static predefined
        subscription for the announced Flowspec filters for telemetry streaming.
        The telemetry data can then be streamed as HTTP POST requests from the
        network element to the remote originator (or any NMS) of the Flowspec
        filter. The datamodel for data streaming is described in <xref
        target="I-D.wu-idr-flowspec-yang-cfg"/>.

        A BGP implementation that requests Flowspec telemetry streaming

        It is possible that more then a single entity is interested in Flowspec
        telemetry data for a specific Flowspec filter. Multiple Flowspec
        Telemetry Streaming extended communities may be associated with a single
        Flowspec filter.
      </t>
      <t>
        Note on interference with Flowspec action communities: <vspace
        blankLines="1" /> The BGP extended community is propagated together
        with the Flowspec NLRI via BGP. It does not interfere with any of the
        Flowspec action communities defined in <xref target="RFC5575" />.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="sec_network_element" title="Flowspec Telemetry Publisher">
      <t>
        A network device that installs a Flowspec filter in the forwarding
        path that has a Telemetry Request Community attached MUST initiate a
        configured subscription over HTTP2 as described in <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-netconf-restconf-notif"/> Section 3.1.3 for restconf
        telemetry data streaming. Its role is a Flowspec Telemetry Publisher.
        The destination IP address and destination TCP port of the telemetry
        receiver is encoded in the extended community (see <xref
        target="sec_requeststreaming" />).
      </t>
      <t>
        Multiple Flowspec filters may share the same telemetry receiver (same
        IP-address AND same TCP port). Only a single streaming connection to
        each streaming receiver SHOULD be established and used for all telemetry
        data for that particular receiver.
      </t>
      <t>
        When a streaming connection is not in use anymore (no more Telemetry
        Requests with a particular telemetry receiver) it MUST be closed. An
        optional teardown delay may be introduced in order to allow a reuse
        for telemetry streaming.
      </t>
      <t>
        It is acceptable that the streaming connection is delayed until actual
        data can be sent (ie. counters of matched packets are not 0). In many
        deployments it may not be possible for a network device to directly
        connect to a remote restconf receiver. An optional outbound HTTP2 proxy
        server SHOULD be configurable on the network device.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="sec_subscription" title="Flowspec Telemetry Subscription">
      <t>
        After successful session setup (see <xref
        target="sec_network_element"/>) the Telemetry Receiver is subscribed by
        the Telemetry Publisher to periodic updates on the selected subtrees
        within the Flowspec YANG datamodel <xref
        target="I-D.wu-idr-flowspec-yang-cfg"/>. The update rate SHALL be
        configurable on the Telemetry Publisher and the default interval SHOULD
        be 300 seconds. The path to the published subtrees within YANG module
        ietf-flowspec is:
        <vspace blankLines="1" />
        /flowspec/flowspec-state/flowspec-statistics/flowspec-stats/flowspec-rule-stats
        <vspace blankLines="1" />
        In case of multiple Flowspec NLRIs requesting Telemetry streaming to the
        same Telemetry Receiver this receiver gets subscribed not only to a
        single entry in the flowspec-rule-stats subtree but to every item that
        it requested streaming for.
      </t>
      <t>
        After session setup an initial subscription-started message is sent to
        the Telemetry Receiver. An example can be found in <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-netconf-restconf-notif"/> Section 3.1.3. During the
        livetime of a Telemetry session, changes in the Flowspec NLRIs on the
        Telemetry Publisher may lead to subscription changes. Successive changes
        to the subscription are handled as configured-subscriptions explained in
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications"/> Section 5.

      <t>
        The IP address and TCP port of the Telemetry Receiver is popagated via
        BGP update messages over the entire Flowspec domain. The Telemetry
        Receiver needs to be accessed from the entire Flowspec domain. The
        Telemetry Receiver is unable to verify to Telemetry Publisher and thus
        needs to accept every incoming session.
